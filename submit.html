        <h2>discord bot way</h2>
        <p>the only way to send them (for now), is using <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1082673589851013183&permissions=0&scope=bot" target="_blank">this discord bot.</a> (wd-sp submit bot#<b>2157</b>)</p>
        <p>because of discord, you have to invite the bot into a server to be able to DM it. you can kick it after, and yes it is dumb, but i can't do anything bout that.</p>
        <p>after you invite it, go into the DMs of the bot and say <code>send</code> along with the attachment.
        you'll probably get a confirmation message, saying it was submitted. all sent videos go through manual review first before they're put on the site.</p>
        <p>nsfw, gore and similar videos <b>aren't allowed</b>, as i haven't implemented a filter for that yet, and i personally wouldn't like seeing that content on this site.</p>
